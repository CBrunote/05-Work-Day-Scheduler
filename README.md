# 05-Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
This project was created to provide a tool for tracking daily tasks for your workday. When the page loads, notice the current date and time underneath the page title. Also notice that the current hour of the day is highlighted in red; while future hours are in green, and past hours are grey. To enter a task, type in the center column and click the save button on the right side of the row. Notice that if you refresh your screen, the tasks re reload to the same slots as before.
